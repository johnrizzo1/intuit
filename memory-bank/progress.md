- Restart script created for the MCP server.
- Unit tests for MCP server functionality implemented and passing.
- Comprehensive MCP documentation added to README.md.
- MCP usage examples added to README.md.
- Practical example script created for using MCP functionality.
- Frameless circular window shaped like a hockey puck implemented using PySide6.
- Isometric 3D effect created with shadowing and gradient effects.
- Dynamic lighting effects (pulse and ripple) implemented that react to AI speech.
- Interactive controls added (keyboard shortcuts and mouse dragging).
- Integration module developed to connect the GUI with the existing AI system.
- Testing tools provided to demonstrate and test the GUI functionality.
- GUI command added to the CLI to start the application in GUI mode.
- Standalone GUI script created that can be run independently.
- Voice integration with the GUI implemented using a multi-process architecture.
- Inter-process communication between GUI and voice processes implemented.
- Speech metrics extraction for dynamic visualization implemented.
- Controls added to toggle voice functionality (keyboard shortcuts and context menu).
- GUI command updated to support voice configuration options.
- Voice functionality enabled by default in the GUI for a more interactive experience.
- Fixed audio playback issue that was causing the application to hang by implementing audio playback in a separate thread.
- Fixed voice recognition issue that was causing the application to hang when it couldn't understand speech.
- Implemented robust conversation flow with automatic listening after speaking.
- Added helpful feedback when speech isn't recognized.
- Fixed issue with conversation stopping after one interaction.
- Ensured continuous conversation loop for a natural interaction experience.
- Implemented simulated AI agent integration to process recognized speech and generate contextual responses.
- Added complete voice conversation flow: speech recognition → AI processing → text-to-speech response.

## What's Left to Build

- Expand tool/plugin ecosystem (beyond productivity tools).
- Enhance vector database capabilities.
- Optimize performance and latency.
- Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback across all tools and interfaces.
- Review and refactor code for maintainability and performance.

## Current Status

- Core system and productivity tools are fully operational.
- MCP integration has been successfully implemented, enabling both client and server functionality.
- The system can now expose its tools to external AI agents and connect to external MCP servers.
- The RAG pipeline has been fixed and is now functioning properly, enabling semantic search of indexed files.
- MCP server functionality is fully tested with passing unit tests.
- MCP integration is comprehensively documented in the README.md with usage examples.
- A practical example script is available for developers to understand how to use MCP functionality.
- A frameless circular window shaped like a hockey puck has been implemented with PySide6.
- The GUI features isometric 3D effects and dynamic lighting that reacts to AI speech.
- Interactive controls allow users to move the window and toggle between different lighting effects.
- The GUI can be integrated with the existing AI system to provide visual feedback during speech.
- The application can be started in GUI mode using the `intuit gui` command.
- A standalone GUI script is available for direct execution without dependencies.

## Known Issues

- Full agent integration with the voice interface is not yet implemented.
- No wake word detection for voice activation.

## Recently Fixed Issues

- Fixed the RAG pipeline by properly connecting the vector store to the FilesystemTool in both the main agent and MCP server.
- Fixed scope issues with imports in the create_agent function.
- Enhanced the VectorStore's search method to handle empty or wildcard queries to list all indexed files.
- Updated the FilesystemTool's search method to properly handle empty queries.
- Updated the agent's prompt to include instructions on how to handle queries about indexed files.
- Fixed indentation issues in the FilesystemTool's _search_files method.
- Added extensive logging throughout the vector store code to help diagnose RAG pipeline issues.
- Added missing CustomMCPTool for the filesystem_search tool in the agent.py file, allowing the agent to use the filesystem tool when asked to list all indexed files.
- Added a special case in the agent's process_input method to directly use the filesystem tool when the user asks to list all indexed files, bypassing the agent_executor.
- Fixed the special case to use the async version of the tool's run method (_arun) instead of the synchronous version (_run) to handle tools that only support async execution.
- Added comprehensive logging to all tool methods (FilesystemTool, CustomMCPTool, MCPToolWrapper) to track when and how they are called, including caller information.
- Reimplemented voice integration with the GUI using a multi-process architecture to resolve stability issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Shifted from initial setup to implementing core features and productivity tools.
- Adopted Pydantic and JSON for structured local data storage.
- Successfully completed the productivity tools milestone.
- Successfully implemented MCP integration, enabling both client and server functionality.
- Used the MCP protocol as a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources.
- Implemented a screenshot tool as a proof of concept for MCP integration.
- Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for MCP tool execution.
- Completed comprehensive documentation and testing for MCP functionality.
- Created practical examples to demonstrate MCP usage for developers.
- Implemented a frameless circular window shaped like a hockey puck for a unique AI visual representation.
- Chose PySide6 for the GUI implementation due to its modern features and animation capabilities.
- Created dynamic lighting effects that react to AI speech for an engaging user experience.
- Added interactive controls for user manipulation of the GUI.
- Designed the GUI to be modular and easily integrated with the existing AI system.
- Adopted a multi-process architecture for voice processing to improve stability and responsiveness.
- Implemented inter-process communication via queues for data exchange between GUI and voice processes.
- Created a configuration system for voice settings via command-line options and configuration files.
