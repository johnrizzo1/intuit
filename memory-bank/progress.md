# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works

- Core agent logic implemented.
- Initial tool plugins (web search, Gmail, weather, filesystem) added.
- CLI and voice user interfaces built and functional.
- File indexing function created for query enrichment.
- Local Calendar tool implemented (add, list, search, delete) using Pydantic/JSON.
- Local Notes tool implemented (add, list, search, delete) using Pydantic/JSON.
- Local Reminders tool implemented (add, list, search, delete) using Pydantic/JSON.
- CLI and voice integration for Calendar, Notes, and Reminders tools.
- Unit tests for Calendar, Notes, and Reminders tools core logic.
- Documentation for Calendar, Notes, and Reminders tools.
- Background process for reminder triggering implemented.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement MCP server functionality to expose Intuit's tools as MCP resources.
- Implement MCP client functionality to connect to external MCP servers.
- Create a screenshot tool using MCP as an example implementation.
- Update the agent to support MCP tools.
- Expand tool/plugin ecosystem (beyond productivity tools).
- Enhance vector database capabilities.
- Optimize performance and latency.
- Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback across all tools and interfaces.
- Review and refactor code for maintainability and performance.

## Current Status

- Core system and productivity tools are fully operational.
- Project is transitioning to implementing MCP integration for enhanced extensibility.

## Known Issues

- No critical issues reported at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Shifted from initial setup to implementing core features and productivity tools.
- Adopted Pydantic and JSON for structured local data storage.
- Successfully completed the productivity tools milestone.
- New focus on implementing MCP integration to enable both client and server functionality.
- Planning to use the MCP protocol as a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources.
