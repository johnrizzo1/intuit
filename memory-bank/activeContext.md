# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and learnings.

## Current Work Focus

Implementing local productivity tools (calendar, notes, reminders) using Pydantic models and JSON file storage.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented core logic, CLI/voice integration, and unit tests for Calendar, Notes, and Reminders tools.
- Defined file structure and naming conventions for all three tools.
- Updated implementation plan to reflect completed steps and the change to Pydantic/JSON storage.
- Documented Calendar, Notes, and Reminders tools.

## Next Steps

- Document the Reminders tool. (Correction: This was just completed, will update in next step)
- Implement logic for triggering reminders at the specified time (requires background process consideration).
- Address general tasks: update memory bank files, ensure consistent error handling, review/refactor code.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All productivity tools are managed locally using Pydantic models and JSON files.
- Both CLI and voice interfaces are supported for implemented features.
- Reminder triggering will require a background process.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Consistent Pydantic/JSON storage pattern across productivity tools.
- Unified backend logic for CLI and voice commands.
- Modular design for tools.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Using Pydantic and JSON provides a structured approach to local data storage.
- Integrating tools with the agent simplifies CLI and voice access.
- Implementing background processes for features like reminders requires careful consideration of architecture.
