# Implementation Plan: Local Productivity Tools

This document outlines the steps for implementing the local calendar, notes, and reminders tools, with checkboxes to track progress.

## Milestone: Implement Local Productivity Tools

**Note:** Storage format changed from plain text to JSON using Pydantic models.

### Calendar Tool

- [x] Define file structure and naming convention for calendar events (using Pydantic and JSON, e.g., `data/calendar/UUID.json`).
- [x] Implement core logic for adding calendar events to files (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for listing calendar events, with optional date filtering (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for searching calendar events by keyword (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for deleting calendar events (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Integrate calendar tool with CLI interface.
- [x] Integrate calendar tool with voice interface.
- [x] Write unit tests for calendar tool logic (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Document calendar tool usage and implementation details.

### Notes Tool

- [x] Define file structure and naming convention for notes (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for adding notes to files (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for listing notes (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for searching notes by keyword (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for deleting notes (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Integrate notes tool with CLI interface.
- [x] Integrate notes tool with voice interface.
- [x] Write unit tests for notes tool logic.
- [x] Document notes tool usage and implementation details.

### Reminders Tool

- [x] Define file structure and naming convention for reminders (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for adding reminders to files, including date/time (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for listing reminders, with optional filtering (e.g., upcoming, completed) (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for searching reminders by keyword (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement core logic for deleting reminders (using Pydantic and JSON).
- [x] Implement logic for triggering reminders (background service created, reads JSON files, triggers voice output, marks as triggered).
- [x] Integrate reminders tool with CLI interface.
- [x] Integrate reminders tool with voice interface.
- [x] Write unit tests for reminders tool logic.
- [x] Document reminders tool usage and implementation details.

## General Tasks

- [x] Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` as milestones are completed.
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback across all tools and interfaces (initial review).
- [ ] Review and refactor code for maintainability and performance (ongoing).
